# Exercise-04a-State-Machine
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 6 October 2020

This exercise is designed to begin our creation of a 2D Platformer, by creating an animated sprite and a State Machine. The concepts behind this exercise will be outlined in class.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-04a-State-Machine. *Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F20 with your full name.* Commit your changes.

Clone the repository to a Local Path on your computer.

Open Godot. Import the project.godot file and open the "State Machine" project.

You should see a very basic 2D Platformer with tiles made from the Godot Logo. A Player (KinematicBody2D) has already been added with a Camera2D, an AnimatedSprite and CollisionShape, and the skeleton of a state machine. The player also has a label that hovers above his head to display its current state.




Test the project. You should be able to see the different states as the character moves, falls, or jumps (in the two different modes).

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-04a-State-Machine) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
